{"name":"Asteroids","tagline":"A clone of the classic arcade game","body":"### Asteroids\r\nA Javascript game based on the classic of the same name. It implements collision detection and bouncing amongst the asteroids, score-keeping, displaying multiple lives, variable speeds and targets fracturing into smaller asteroids upon a successful hits. The sprites for the various game components are taken from outside images. The bounce mechanic implements a collision-check which looks one-step ahead for each moving-object. Otherwise, the program runs the risk of drawing overlapping moving objects and then running the collision-check (and subsequent bounce). This results in static objects, as they are perpetually bouncing off one another. This implementation avoids that issue.\r\n\r\nTo try it, just download the zip file, unzip it, and open the html file.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
